# TextToQR

The web application will be a simple and user-friendly tool that allows users to convert text into QR codes. It will be built using the ReactJS framework and Material UI library for the UI design. The application will consist of a single page that displays a text box where users can enter the text they want to convert into a QR code.

Once the user enters the text and clicks on the 'Generate QR Code' button, the application will use a QR code generator library to create the QR code image. The image will be displayed on the same page, along with a download button that allows the user to save the QR code as a PNG or SVG file.

The web application will also include a feature that allows users to customize the appearance of the QR code by choosing from a set of predefined styles. Users can choose from different color schemes, patterns, and sizes to create a unique QR code that suits their needs.

The application will be responsive and optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It will be easy to use, with clear instructions and intuitive user interface design. Overall, the web application will be a valuable tool for anyone looking to create QR codes quickly and easily.
